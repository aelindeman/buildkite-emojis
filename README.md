# Buildkite Emojis

Custom emojis supported by [Buildkite](https://buildkite.com/) that you can use in your Buildkite pipelines, including the terminal output of builds, as well as in test suites and registries.

To use an emoji, write the name of the emoji in between colons, like :buildkite: which shows up as <img src="img-buildkite-64/buildkite.png" alt="drawing" width="16" height="16"/>

## Contributing a new emoji
